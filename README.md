# Monoidal_Coherence_and_Binary_Words
Implementation of the category of binary words in Python for its application to Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem for monoidal categories. There are interesting combinatorial and geometric properties of this category, and due to its recursive nature, it can be programmed, making investigation of such properties much easier and efficient.
